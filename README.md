# hotel-chi-responsive.github.io
This is a hotel website inspired by Traversy Media's boot-camp. This project showcases a bit of Chicago, you will notice the historic architecture and the color scheme of the Chicago flag.  Web Design tools: -HTML   I learned better organization and utilization of the web page. I've gained  better insight of html semantics as well as how html structures  a web-page.  -CSS   I have gained more insight into the art of floating objects, and a better command of the box model.    -MEDIA Queries(responsiveness)  I've acquired a better understanding into how, and when to use media queries to create  responsive designs. I've decided to focus on a mobile first approach.  Thanks Traversy Media
